# About me:
I am a self-taught web developer. My programming journey started in 2016 with VBA and Python mostly for process automation. Eventually I moved on to learn web development - HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node JS and express.

If you are interested in my self-education journey, you can read more about it at my [blog](https://vast-ocean-04071.herokuapp.com/post/615af8cff0f2fe5438fb200d).
