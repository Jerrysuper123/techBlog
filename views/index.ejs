                    Are you still curious?
                </h3>
                <p>Hi, my name is Jerry and I majored in business in my uni year, focusing on Finance. Having worked
                    2 years
                    in strategic consulting, then I moved on
                    to one of the fortune 500 companies to learn the commercial side of things. While in the
                    business world,
                    for my curiosity in technology,
                    I self-taught my self web development technology. I did not plan out the self-taught journey as
                    such but
                    due to Covid19, I
                    have to postpone my plan of further studies in computer science. So I started self-learning
                    while
                    WFH...After about 1 year, I have the modules that
                    are offered by most bootcamps, while refering to their course contents.
                </p>

                <p>Why curiosity as the centre piece of this blog? During my journey of learning business and tech,
                    I
                    released
                    curiosity is a form of super energy that lies dormant within you and me. With this realization,
                    I was
                    able harness this untapped
                    energy to accelerate my learning. In this blog, I will share with you all about this, while
                    specifically
                    focusing on business and technology because
                    both has become increasingly connected nowadays.
